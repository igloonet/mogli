This is a Fork of the original gem https://github.com/mmangino/mogli.
It was forked because HTTParty 0.7.8 no longer responds to "parsed_response", but fixes the "has_key?" error.
https://github.com/mmangino/mogli/issues/30

This is the only change so far:
Mogli::User#fetch_permissions

perms_query_result = client.fql_query(fql).parsed_response.first
->
perms_query_result = client.fql_query(fql).first

One test will fail but that's because the HTTParty stub passes :parsed_response around, I'll try to fix it eventually.
The permissions should work correctly though, tested it with real Facebook account.
